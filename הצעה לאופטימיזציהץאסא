‚óè Backend Optimizations

  1. Pagination with Cursor-based Navigation
    - Replace offset-based pagination with cursor-based for better performance
    - Use StudentId as cursor for consistent ordering
  2. Database Query Optimization
    - Implement filtered queries at database level
    - Add composite indexes for common search patterns
    - Use query projections to fetch only needed fields
  3. Caching Strategy
    - Redis/Memory caching for frequently accessed data
    - Cache invalidation strategies for data updates
    - Query result caching with expiration

  Frontend Optimizations

  1. Progressive Loading
    - Load initial subset immediately
    - Implement infinite scroll with batch loading
    - Prefetch next batch while user scrolls
  2. Data Virtualization Enhancements
    - Implement row height estimation for variable content
    - Add column virtualization for wide tables
    - Optimize re-rendering with React.memo-like patterns
  3. Client-side Filtering/Search
    - Implement debounced search
    - Filter visible data locally before server requests
    - Cache search results

  User-Specific Large Data Handling

  For varying data per user:

  1. Dynamic Query Building
    - Build queries based on user permissions/data access
    - Implement user-specific indexing strategies
    - Use database views for complex user-specific queries
  2. Adaptive UI
    - Adjust virtual scroll parameters based on data density
    - Dynamic column hiding for users with many fields
    - Personalized data prioritization
  3. Background Processing
    - Pre-aggregate user-specific data
    - Implement data summarization for dashboard views
    - Use background jobs for heavy computations
